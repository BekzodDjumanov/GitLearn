<h2>Continuous Deployment</h2>
<p>Continuous deployment is the practice of frequently releasing or deploying code that has been verified through external models such as automated tests. It ensures that software is always in a deployable state and accelerates the release process, reducing bottlenecks and improving feedback speed.</p>

<h2 class="guide-title">Core Concepts</h2>

<div class="list-elements">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fully Automated Releases: </strong>No manual intervention after code passes CI tests.</li>

        <li><strong>Reduced Deployment Risk: </strong>Smaller, frequent updates lower the chance of major failures.</li>

        <li><strong>Faster User Feedback: </strong>Changes reach users quickly, allowing faster improvements.</li>

        <li><strong>Requires Strong Testing Culture: </strong>Automation must be reliable to avoid pushing broken code.</li>

        <li><strong>Cost Heavy: </strong> the process of deployment can incur significant expenditure depending on workflow models and configuration.</li>
    </ul>

<h2 class="guide-title">Common CD Workflow</h2>

<div class="git-init-badge-workflow" style="margin-top: 1rem; display: block;">
    <span2># Developer pushes changes to main branch <br></span2>
    git push origin main<br><br>
    
    <span2># CI pipeline runs: </span2><br>
    <span2># 1. Install dependencies</span2><br>
    <span2># 2. Build production-ready artifacts (e.g., Docker image)</span2><br>
    <span2># 3. Run integration and end-to-end tests</span2><br>
    <span2># 4. Report success or failure</span2><br><br>
    
    <span2># CD pipeline runs automatically if CI passes: </span2><br>
    <span2># 1. Deploy artifacts to production environment</span2><br>
    <span2># 2. Run post-deployment smoke tests</span2><br>
    <span2># 3. Monitor logs and metrics for issues</span2><br>
