<h2>Commenting & Naming</h2>
<p>
  When writing effective, sustainable, and clean code, it's always best practice
  to include comments for other developers to understand the authors purpose.
  Without comments, code is simply just code that can only be deciphered by one
  who understands the language (e.g Python, Java, HTML).
