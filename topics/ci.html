<h2>Continuous Integration</h2>
<p>Continuous integration is the practice of frequently updating or implementing small code changes into a shared repository. This can range from once a day to 100 per week.</p>

<h2 class="guide-title">Core Concepts</h2>

<div class="list-elements">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Frequent Commits: </strong>Developers modify and commit changes often.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Automated Builds: </strong>Every push triggers an automated process that compiles the code.</li>

        <li><strong>Automated Testing: </strong>Unit, integration, and style checks run automatically to catch errors.</li>

        <li><strong>Immediate Feedback: </strong>If an error is detected within the pipeline, the cause it addressed accordingly.</li>

        <li><strong>Consistent Environment: </strong>Build scripts and tests run in identical environments (e.g., using Docker or virtual machines to safeguard proprietary products).</li>
    </ul>

<p>To prevent software discrepancies early and maintain clean code.</p>

<h2 class="guide-title">Common CI Workflow</h2>

<div class="git-init-badge-workflow" style="margin-top: 1rem; display: block;">
    <span2># Developer pushes changes <br></span2>
    git push origin feature/add-search<br><br>

    <span2>  # CI system (e.g., GitHub Actions) runs: </span2><br>
    <span2>  # 1. Install dependencies</span2><br>
    <span2>  # 2. Build the project</span2><br>
    <span2>  # 3. Run tests</span2><br>
    <span2>  # 4. Report success or failure</span2><br>
