<h2>Triggers</h2>
<p>CI/CD triggers indicate when pipelines are initiated, typically when set by specific instructions on how and when to run. Common triggers are code pushes or pull requests.</p>

<h2 class="guide-title">Common Triggers</h2>

<div class="list-elements">
    <ul>

<div class="list-elements">
    <ul>
        <li>Run pipelines without manual intervention.</li>

        <li>Automatically test or build code after changes.</li>

        <li>Immediate feedback on commits or pull requests.</li>

        <li>Keeps the main branch stable and deployable.</li>
    </ul>
