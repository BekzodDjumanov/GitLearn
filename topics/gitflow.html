<h2>Gitflow Workflow</h2>
<p>A gitflow workflow is a large-scale branching model that orchestrates work into multiple branches for structured and cohesive development. It uses several branch types to separate features, releases, hotfixes, and the main development branch.</p>

<h2 class="guide-title">How it Works</h2>

<div class="list-elements">
    <ul>
        <li>1. Main (main or master) branch — contains only production-ready code. </li>

        <li>2. Develop branch — integration branch where features are merged before release.</li>
            
        <li>3. Feature branches — branched from develop for new features.</li>

        <li>4. Release branches — branched from develop to prepare a new production release.</li>

        <li>5. Hotfix branches — branched from main to quickly fix production issues.</li>

        <li>6. Merge back into develop and/or main when complete.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2 class="guide-title">When to Use</h2>

<div class="list-elements">
    <ul>
        <li>Medium to large projects with multiple developers.</li>

        <li>Projects requiring clear release and hotfix management.</li>
            
        <li>Teams using CI/CD pipelines and code review processes.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2 class="guide-title">Common Workflow Command</h2>

<div class="git-init-badge-workflow" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
    <span2># Start a new feature branch from develop <br></span2>
    <span class="prompt">$</span> git checkout develop <br>
    <span class="prompt">$</span> git checkout -b feature/new-dashboard <br><br>

    <span2># Finish feature branch and merge back to develop <br></span2>
    <span class="prompt">$</span> git checkout develop <br>
    <span class="prompt">$</span> git merge feature/new-dashboard <br><br>

   <span2># Start a release branch <br></span2>
    <span class="prompt">$</span> git checkout -b release/1.2.0 develop <br><br>
    
    <span2># Finish release branch, merge into main and develop <br></span2>
    <span class="prompt">$</span> git checkout main <br>

<div class="list-elements">
    <ul>
        <li>Keeps production code stable.</li>

        <li>Supports parallel development. </li>
        
        <li>Organized release and hotfix process.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2 class="summary" style="color: oklch(87.1% 0.30 30)">Disadvantages</h2>

<div class="list-elements">
    <ul>
        <li>Highly complex and much more demanding than other workflows.</li>

        <li>Requires strict adherence to branching rules.</li>
            
    </ul>
</div>

<h2 class="summary">Summary</h2>
<p class="summary-sub">Gitflow is a structured workflow that uses multiple branches — like develop, feature, release, and hotfix — which are merged into main only when ready for production.</p>
