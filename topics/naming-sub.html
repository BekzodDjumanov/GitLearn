<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>
<p>Naming Conventions are a subtopic of GitLearn, which explore the importance of assigning proper titles in software. Effective commenting, clear naming conventions, and well-structured commit messages are core practices in Git and software development. Mastering these techniques ensures your code is readable, maintainable, and easy to collaborate on, while providing a clear history of changes for your team.</p>
